            “Space Exploration is important research for economic and national
            defense, and America’s space program is a symbol of our success as a
            scientifically and technologically advanced nation” - Randy Forbes

        <p class="center">
          A big part of space exploration is sending spacecrafts into space to
          orbit planets, collect large amounts of data, and take images.
          Scientists then create maps of these planets by using the images and
          data collected. These maps play a crucial role in learning more about
          a planet and its surface. In order for researchers to use planetary
          mapping and collect data NASA told USGS to create a way to view maps
          of other planets virtually. Trent Hare, a research developer and data
          processor for USGS, is in charge of promoting planetary mapping by
          attending expos and finding others to get involved in creating a way
          to view maps of planets virtually.

          <h2>Current Issues</h2>
          <br />
          <span class="byline">
            The USGS team created a planetary mapping application by modifying
            version 2 OpenLayers, an open-source mapping application. The
            mapping application has been very useful to many researchers for
            displaying USGS’s planetary data but it has many drawbacks.

          <img
            src="./img/USGSMoonMap.jpg"
            width="600"
            height="500"

          />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p class="center">
          There are two main drawbacks when it comes to their current
          implementation. The first being that OpenLayers does not support
          planetary mapping. All the different maps USGS created for the
          different planets and moons think that they are still Earth. They are
          currently “faking” the data (modifying the data based on conversions
          from one planet or body to Earth) to map all of these different
          bodies. This causes the data to be represented inaccurately. The
          second major drawback with their current implementation is that the
          current codebase for OpenLayers is not modular. The Openlayers
          codebase has updated its code to an entirely new codebase that no
          longer supports the code written years ago by USGS. Since their code
          is not modular, the USGS development team is having to rewrite the
          OpenLayers code to make the planetary maps work with the updated
          version of OpenLayers. Without the code being modular they will always
          have a development team because there is no long term solution when
          working with just OpenLayers. Their code needs to be modular so that
          even if one open-source mapping application fails or does not support
          the code anymore, they will still have a program that works.

          <h2>Envisioned Solution</h2>
          <br />
          <span class="byline">
            Our envisioned solution is to create a JavaScript node package
            containing the required mapping translations that can be used across
            multiple mapping applications. We will also build a Leaflet mapping
            application that will use this package to display maps created by
            USGS.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            The application will allow users to zoom, move the location of the
            view, select an area on the map, see gazetteer names and symbols on
            the map, use variable radii, convert between 0:360 and -180:180
            longitude ranges, convert between ographic and ocentric latitudes,
            and load data layers. The Leaflet application will connect to the
            USGS database containing data on their maps and have an autocomplete
            search to find maps from the database. Two end goals of this project
            are to have our node package incorporated into the Leaflet API and
            to allow the USGS team to use our package in their OpenLayers
            implementation.

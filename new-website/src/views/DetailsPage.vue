                An important part of space exploration is launching satellites
                into space toorbit planetary bodies, collect large amounts of
                data, and take images of these bodies. The data and images are
                sent back to Earth and used by the planetary science community
                to create planetary maps. These maps play a crucial role in
                understanding more about these bodies and their surfaces. For
                example, the USGS Astrogeology Center helped create the maps
                used for the Apollo 11 mission landing sites. This is a map of
                the created by USGS. There are many different tools for
                scientists to create these maps, but we don’t really have a good
                tool to view these maps virtually, and our project aims to solve
                this problem.

                    The USGS team created a planetary mapping application by
                    modifying OpenLayer v2, an open-source mapping application.
                    The mapping application has been very useful to many
                    researchers for displaying USGS’s planetary data but it has
                    two main drawbacks of OpenLayers:

                    <ol class="text-left">
                      <li>It does not support planetary mapping</li>
                      <li>
                        It is not modular or expandable in nature
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    All of the maps that USGS created for planets and moons are
                    currently “faking” the data (modifying the data based on
                    conversions from one planet or body to Earth's radius) to
                    map all of these different bodies. This causes the data to
                    be represented inaccurately. The Openlayers codebase has
                    updated its code to an entirely new codebase that no longer
                    supports the code written years ago by USGS. Since their
                    code is not modular, the USGS development team is having to
                    rewrite the OpenLayers code to make the planetary maps work
                    with the updated version of OpenLayers. Their code needs to
                    be modular so that even if one open-source mapping
                    application fails or does not support the code anymore, they
                    will still have a working program.

                    Our envisioned solution is to create a JavaScript node
                    package containing the required mapping translations that
                    can be used across multiple mapping applications. We will
                    also build a Leaflet mapping application that will use this
                    package to display maps created by USGS.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The application will allow users to zoom, move the location
                    of the view, select an area on the map, see gazetteer names
                    and symbols on the map, use variable radii, convert between
                    0:360 and -180:180 longitude ranges, convert between
                    ographic and ocentric latitudes, and load data layers. The
                    Leaflet application will connect to the USGS database
                    containing data on their maps and have an autocomplete
                    search to find maps from the database. Two end goals of this
                    project are to have our node package incorporated into the
                    Leaflet API and to allow the USGS team to use our package in
                    their OpenLayers implementation.

                    From a user-level perspective, we have identified three
                    domain-level requirements that our project needs to satisfy:

                    <ol class="text-left">
                      <li>
                        We must deliver an application that displays planetary
                        data through an interactive viewer that is embedded in a
                        web-based environment.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The application must accomplish the primary goal of
                        being research-driven in nature.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        We must create a portable package that can be used
                        across multiple mapping applications.
